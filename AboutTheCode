# About the program

I messed this up so much that not even AI could help me solve this mess.

I'm not sure if I'm using pointers correctly here, nor do I know why my code finishes after adding any input. I thought it could be that there was no "getchar()", but turns out it wasn't for this reason.

Can someone help me solve this problem?
